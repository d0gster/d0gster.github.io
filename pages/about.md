# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

With over a decade of experience as a full-stack developer, I've built a strong foundation in PHP and Laravel, focusing on creating scalable and high-performance solutions. My expertise extends across the entire software development lifecycle, from analyzing business needs to deployment and maintenance.

My journey is marked by a deep-rooted passion for both infrastructure and code. My early career in IT gave me an unparalleled understanding of system architecture, allowing me to deliver solutions that are not only functional but also robust and reliable. I have a proven track record of solving complex problems, from unblocking stalled server migrations in minutes to re-architecting systems for massive performance gains.

More recently, I have immersed myself in the world of Artificial Intelligence. I am now focused on integrating my development and infrastructure background with a forward-thinking approach to AI and machine learning. This blend of experience enables me to build intelligent, optimized, and future-proof applications that learn and evolve. I am passionate about leveraging new technologies to automate processes, improve code quality, and solve business challenges in innovative ways.
